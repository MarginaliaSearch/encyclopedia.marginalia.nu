# OpenZIM

[OpenZIM](https://github.com/openzim/libzim) - GPL-2.0

OpenZIM is a ZIM file reader. This code has been modified in a fairly crude manner 
to be much faster than the original code base which seems quite antique. It also 
supports XZ compression.

**Important Note** the license is incompatible with AGPL 3, so we can't link Marginalia 
directly to this. It's still very useful for building tools that deal with 
wikipedia data which would be stand-alone.
